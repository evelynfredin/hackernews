## To Run This Code On Your Machine

You need:

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/docs.php)
- [Laravel 8x](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html)

When you're ready you can:

1. Clone this repo

```
  git clone https://github.com/evelynfredin/hackernews.git
```

2. Navigate to the right directory `$ cd /path/to/directory/`

3. Install dependencies

```
  composer install
```

4. Copy the `.env.example` file

```
cp .env.example .env
```

5. Set up an application key

```
php artisan key:generate
```

6. Create a Symlink for showing and storing avatars

```
php artisan storage:link
```

7. Get a server running

```
php artisan serve
```

## Code Review

1. Database cannot be found using the path defined in `.env.example`. Remove and update config/database.php with `database_path('database.sqlite')` â†’ `('database.db')` instead.

2. It is possible to delete other users accounts by changing the form id to another users.

3. It would be good to regenerate session id on login as to prevent session fixation attacks. Auth:attempt does not do this by default.

4. Avatar upload does not handle PostTooLargeException.

5. Consider using resource controllers for your CRUD routes.

6. Passing in old values as shown on register would be good for post description as to not lose post content on invalid url/title.

7. Gorgeous design, dark mode looks stunning!

8. "No comments" redirect in /comments leads to /submit for posts instead of showing existing posts to comment on.

9. The use of tailwind component classes for styling is very clean!

10. Overall code and functionality is excellent, it looks like you really learned and utilized as much as you possibly could!
